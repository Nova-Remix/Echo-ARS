# Times

Some keys will allow for you to use a time, as in Seconds, Minutes, Hours, etc. Here are the bases for what you can use:

| Time | Base | Usage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Nano Seconds** | ns | {key:2000ns} |
| **Milli Seconds** | ms | {key:2000ms} |  
| **Seconds** | s | {key:20s} |  
| **Minutes** | m | {key:2m} |  
| **Hours** | h | {key:1h} |
> Hours and above are **NOT** recommended since Echo is frequently updated! If Echo is updated during the process of the key waiting to be activated, it will completely reset itself \(Meaning the time will stop and won't restart unless the command is used again\).

# Echo ARS
Welcome to the Basic `Echo A.R.S Documentation.` This is **NOT** the official documentation.

## What Does This Documentation Contain?
This documentation contains all the basic information needed about some of the keys for the A.R.S along with examples.

## What's The Purpose If There's Already A Website?
The website is actually the old website and is outdated. If you wish to take a look at it and get a feel of all the keys and descriptions with examples, feel free to do so [here](http://proxikal.github.io/Echo/).

# Times

Some keys will allow for you to use a time, as in Seconds, Minutes, Hours, etc. Here are the bases for what you can use:

| Time | Base | Usage |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Nano Seconds** | ns | {key:2000ns} |
| **Milli Seconds** | ms | {key:2000ms} |
| **Seconds** | s | {key:20s} |
| **Minutes** | m | {key:2m} |
| **Hours** | h | {key:1h} |
> Hours and above are **NOT** recommended since Echo is frequently updated! If Echo is updated during the process of the key waiting to be activated, it will completely reset itself \(Meaning the time will stop and won't restart unless the command is used again\).

# Compatible With Targeting
Compatible with Targeting means that the key can be used even if you mention a user (Aka the key will target the mentioned user rather than the person who used the command).

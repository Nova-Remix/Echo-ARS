# Echo ARS
Welcome to the Basic `Echo A.R.S Documentation.` This is **NOT** the official documentation.

## What Does This Documentation Contain?
This documentation contains all the basic information needed about some of the keys for the A.R.S along with examples.

## What's The Purpose If There's Already A Website?
The website is actually the old website and is outdated. If you wish to take a look at it and get a feel of all the keys and descriptions with examples, feel free to do so [here](http://proxikal.github.io/Echo/).
